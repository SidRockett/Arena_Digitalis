# Arena_Digitalis
Arena Digitalis is a granular sampler based on the Arduino Nano R4
Controls:
MIX - Blends your raw synth with the processed grains. Set to 50% for a "shimmer" effect behind your playing.
SIZE - Controls the duration of each slice. Turn Left for "micro-glitch" clicks; turn Right for long, overlapping echoes.
SPEED - Sets playback rate. 7 o'clock is slow/deep; 12 o'clock is near-normal; 5 o'clock is high-pitched chirps.
TONE - A Low-Pass Filter. Turn Left to muffle the sound (good for dark ambient); Right to let the digital "crunch" shine.
FREEZE - Stops recording new audio into the buffer and continuously loops the "grains" already stored in its memory.
RANDOM - The read head jumps to a random spot in the buffer every time a grain finishes.
